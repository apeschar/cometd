cometd is an Erlang implementation of a comet server.

It consists of an HTTP server based on Mochiweb and a simple control
server.

usage
-----

  > cometd:start(HttpPort, ControlPort).

http server
-----------

The following paths are available:

  /longpoll/Channel/LastID
    Get one message from Channel, with its message ID higher than LastId.
    Replies with javascript: _msg(ID, Channel, Data);
    After receiving a message, you need to store its ID to use as LastId
    in the next request.

I will add a Javascript library to this distribution in the near future.

control protocol
----------------

The control protocol is command-oriented and very simple. Simply connect
to your host at ControlPort and send one of these commands. In case of any
errors you will receive a reply like this:

  ERROR: reason

Commands:

  MESSAGE Channel Data
    Post a message containing Data to Channel. Replies with "OK".
  PING
    Keep-alive message. Replies with "PONG".
